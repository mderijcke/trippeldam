		<h2>About Trippeldam</h2>
		
		<img src="images/tomhenks.jpg" alt="Mayor Pols" class="about-pic">
		
		<p>Trippeldam is a nice and joyful city to walk, stay or to shop some time.
		It has got the atmosphere of an old-fashioned village but also the modern influences of the contemporary time.</p>
		
		<p>We have a lot of shops and you can also dine in the many restaurants we have. Even for the children there are a lot of fun things to do such as, a playground, swimming pool and a craft center where they can make their own candles, bracelets and many more things.</p>
		
		<p>While the wives are shopping and the kids are playing, the fathers can relax in one of our pubs, got to the Mediamarkt for the newest technology or pay a visit to our own soccer team, FC Trippeldam.</p>
		
		<p>Next to the soccer fields we have a big sports complex where you can fitness, box and much more.
		Trippeldam also has got a big forest where you, for example, can walk and take pictures.</p>
		
		<p>Around the holidays we have a lot of activities and events you can visit.
		Like with Christmas we have got an ice rink and a giant Christmas tree.</p>
		
		<p>We also have a nice mayor named Mr. Pols.
		Mayor Pols is already 15 years mayor of Trippeldam and so far there are no complaints about him.</p>
		
		<p>He listens careful to the people and tries to take their opinions with him in the decisions that are taken.
		He is also always present with important events.</p>
